this is the entry point for extracting k-best hypotheses . it computes all of them , writing the results to the bufferedwriter passed in . if you want intermediate access to the k-best derivations , you 'll want to call getkthhyp ( ) or getkthderivation ( ) directly . the number of derivations that are looked for is controlled by the `top-n` parameter . note that when `top-n` is set to 0 , k-best extraction is disabled entirely , and only things like the viterbi string and the model score are available to the decoder . since k-best extraction involves the recomputation of features to get the component values , turning off that extraction saves a lot of time when only the 1-best string is desired .

calculates whether we need to reevluate the key for the region entry we added a way to determine whether to reevaluate an entry for query execution the method is to keep track of the delta and current time in a single long value the value is then used by the query to determine if a region entry needs to be reevaluated , based on subtracting the value with the query execution time . this provides a delta + some false positive time ( dts ) if the dts + last modified time of the region entry is > query start time , we can assume that it needs to be reevaluated this is to fix bug 47475 , where references to region entries can be held by the executing query either directly or indirectly ( iterators can hold references for next ) but the values underneath could change . small amounts of false positives are ok as it will have a slight impact on performance

tcp/ip stack and the xntcp interface provide enough buffering to avoid overrun . however , queueing commands faster than they can be processed should in general be avoided . to this purpose , a counter is incremented each time a packet is queued and decremented when a reply from the interface is received . when the counter reaches the pre-defined maximum ( e.g . 15 ) queuing of commands is blocked . owing to broadcasts from the command station , the number of commands received can actually be higher than that of commands sent , but this fact simply implies that we may have a higher number of pending commands for a while , without any negative consequence ( the maximum is however arbitrary ) .

if vec is a stringvector representing an expression , then this returns the stringvector obtained by parenthesizing the expression if it may need parenthesizing . this is used only to prevent parsing errors when the expression appears immediately to the right of an `` = '' in the spec . this is a rare situation , so it would be nice to add the parentheses only if really necessary . for now , the parentheses are added if one of the following tokens occur outside parentheses and not inside a string : * = # < not followed by < > not followed by > or preceded by = | preceded or followed by - \ not followed by `` o '' or `` x '' . / followed by `` \ '' * left parentheses are * ( [ { < < * the handling of `` \ '' is a simplifying hack . lots of operators beginning with `` \ '' like `` \/ '' , `` \gg '' and `` \subseteq '' have precedence greater than or equal to `` = '' . the only commonly used ones with precedence lower than `` = '' seem to be `` \o '' and `` \x '' . it does n't seem to be worth the bother of checking for the others just to avoid unnecessarily adding the parentheses when those other rare operators are used . * perhaps the one improvement that might be worth making in this procedure is to have it not add parentheses because of `` dangerous '' operations in an if clause -- for example : * if x < 0 then ... * this would require considering `` if '' to be a left parenthesis and `` then '' to be a right parenthesis . however , that 's not trivial to implement because of unlikely things like * ifx : = 42 ; x : = ifx < thenx

causes current thread to wait until either another thread invokes the method or the method for this object , or a specified amount of time has elapsed . the current thread must own this object 's monitor . this method causes the current thread ( call it t ) to place itself in the wait set for this object and then to relinquish any and all synchronization claims on this object . thread t becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until one of four things happens : some other thread invokes the notify method for this object and thread t happens to be arbitrarily chosen as the thread to be awakened . some other thread invokes the notifyall method for this object . some other thread interrupts thread t. the specified amount of real time has elapsed , more or less . if timeout is zero , however , then real time is not taken into consideration and the thread simply waits until notified . the thread t is then removed from the wait set for this object and re-enabled for thread scheduling . it then competes in the usual manner with other threads for the right to synchronize on the object ; once it has gained control of the object , all its synchronization claims on the object are restored to the status quo ante - that is , to the situation as of the time that the wait method was invoked . thread t then returns from the invocation of the wait method . thus , on return from the wait method , the synchronization state of the object and of thread t is exactly as it was when the wait method was invoked . if the current thread is interrupted by another thread while it is waiting , then an interruptedexception is thrown . this exception is not thrown until the lock status of this object has been restored as described above . note that the wait method , as it places the current thread into the wait set for this object , unlocks only this object ; any other objects on which the current thread may be synchronized remain locked while the thread waits . this method should only be called by a thread that is the owner of this object 's monitor . see the notify method for a description of the ways in which a thread can become the owner of a monitor .

causes current thread to wait until either another thread invokes the method or the method for this object , or a specified amount of time has elapsed . the current thread must own this object 's monitor . this method causes the current thread ( call it t ) to place itself in the wait set for this object and then to relinquish any and all synchronization claims on this object . thread t becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until one of four things happens : some other thread invokes the notify method for this object and thread t happens to be arbitrarily chosen as the thread to be awakened . some other thread invokes the notifyall method for this object . some other thread interrupts thread t. the specified amount of real time has elapsed , more or less . if timeout is zero , however , then real time is not taken into consideration and the thread simply waits until notified . the thread t is then removed from the wait set for this object and re-enabled for thread scheduling . it then competes in the usual manner with other threads for the right to synchronize on the object ; once it has gained control of the object , all its synchronization claims on the object are restored to the status quo ante - that is , to the situation as of the time that the wait method was invoked . thread t then returns from the invocation of the wait method . thus , on return from the wait method , the synchronization state of the object and of thread t is exactly as it was when the wait method was invoked . if the current thread is interrupted by another thread while it is waiting , then an interruptedexception is thrown . this exception is not thrown until the lock status of this object has been restored as described above . note that the wait method , as it places the current thread into the wait set for this object , unlocks only this object ; any other objects on which the current thread may be synchronized remain locked while the thread waits . this method should only be called by a thread that is the owner of this object 's monitor . see the notify method for a description of the ways in which a thread can become the owner of a monitor .

creates a string representation of the double argument . all characters mentioned below are ascii characters . if the argument is nan , the result is the string `` nan '' . otherwise , the result is a string that represents the sign and magnitude ( absolute value ) of the argument . if the sign is negative , the first character of the result is '- ' ( '- ' ) ; if the sign is positive , no sign character appears in the result . as for the magnitude : if is infinity , it is represented by the characters `` infinity '' ; thus , positive infinity produces the result `` infinity '' and negative infinity produces the result `` -infinity '' . if is zero , it is represented by the characters `` 0.0 '' ; thus , negative zero produces the result `` -0.0 '' and positive zero produces the result `` 0.0 '' . if is greater than or equal to 10-3 but less than 107 , then it is represented as the integer part of , in decimal form with no leading zeroes , followed by ' . ' ( . ) , followed by one or more decimal digits representing the fractional part of . if is less than 10-3 or not less than 107 , then it is represented in so-called `` computerized scientific notation . '' let be the unique integer such that 10n = 10n+1 ; then let be the mathematically exact quotient of and 10n so that 1 = 10 . the magnitude is then represented as the integer part of , as a single decimal digit , followed by ' . ' ( . ) , followed by decimal digits representing the fractional part of , followed by the letter 'e ' ( e ) , followed by a representation of as a decimal integer , as produced by the method . how many digits must be printed for the fractional part of m or a ? there must be at least one digit to represent the fractional part , and beyond that as many , but only as many , more digits as are needed to uniquely distinguish the argument value from adjacent values of type double . that is , suppose that x is the exact mathematical value represented by the decimal representation produced by this method for a finite nonzero argument d. then d must be the double value nearest to x ; or if two double values are equally close to x , then d must be one of them and the least significant bit of the significand of d must be 0 .

parses elements with the given parser .
gets the gap between this interval and another interval . the other interval can be either before or after this interval . < p > intervals are inclusive of the start instant and exclusive of the end . an interval has a gap to another interval if there is a non-zero duration between them . this method returns the amount of the gap only if the intervals do actually have a gap between them . if the intervals overlap or abut , then null is returned . < p > when two intervals are compared the result is one of three states : ( a ) they abut , ( b ) there is a gap between them , ( c ) they overlap . the abuts state takes precedence over the other two , thus a zero duration interval at the start of a larger interval abuts and does not overlap . < p > the chronology of the returned interval is the same as that of this interval ( the chronology of the interval parameter is not used ) . note that the use of the chronology was only correctly implemented in version 1.3 .

if vec is a stringvector representing an expression , then this returns the stringvector obtained by parenthesizing the expression if it may need parenthesizing . this is used only to prevent parsing errors when the expression appears immediately to the right of an `` = '' in the spec . this is a rare situation , so it would be nice to add the parentheses only if really necessary . for now , the parentheses are added if one of the following tokens occur outside parentheses and not inside a string : * = # < not followed by < > not followed by > or preceded by = | preceded or followed by - \ not followed by `` o '' or `` x '' . / followed by `` \ '' * left parentheses are * ( [ { < < * the handling of `` \ '' is a simplifying hack . lots of operators beginning with `` \ '' like `` \/ '' , `` \gg '' and `` \subseteq '' have precedence greater than or equal to `` = '' . the only commonly used ones with precedence lower than `` = '' seem to be `` \o '' and `` \x '' . it does n't seem to be worth the bother of checking for the others just to avoid unnecessarily adding the parentheses when those other rare operators are used . * perhaps the one improvement that might be worth making in this procedure is to have it not add parentheses because of `` dangerous '' operations in an if clause -- for example : * if x < 0 then ... * this would require considering `` if '' to be a left parenthesis and `` then '' to be a right parenthesis . however , that 's not trivial to implement because of unlikely things like * ifx : = 42 ; x : = ifx < thenx
